Programmer II Exercise

- Create a simple webpage with the following requirements:
  - accepts user input in the form of a text box
  - upon user selection of a submit button or other control, input
data is processed in some way (e.g. capitalized, MD5 hash, reversed,
etc)
  - processed data is displayed at the top of the webpage while
preserving the original functionality for user input (clear text box)
  - each successive submission appends to the end of the data at the
top of the page
  - each row of displayed data is accompanied by a delete button which
can be used to delete that row
  - page should be usable on large screens and mobile devices with
dynamic scaling if a browser window is resized
  - an additional user control should be available to sort the user
input displayed at the top of the page and replace the old content
with the new, sorted content
